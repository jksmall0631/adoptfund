Crowd-sourced fundraising platform for families who want to adopt a child


Adopt Fund is a crowd-sourced fundraising platform for families who want to adopt a child but can't afford the average cost of $30,000. This is the front end repo, and the front end was built in React with Redux utilizing Sass. A big thanks to Joshua Small, Chelle Tuerk, Lauren Pesce, and Mike Ziccardi. 

The backend repo built in Node with Express is here: https://github.com/noahpeden/adoptfund-api/
