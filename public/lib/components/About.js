        <p className='about-text' >A normal adoption in the United States costs about $30,000
        and  most families cannot afford this amount out of pocket.
        Adopt Fund is the answer to this problem. Families who are looking to adopt
        can come to Adopt Fund's crowd-sourced fundraising platform, create a Family Fund,
        and share their Fund with friends and family. Contributors can
        then donate to families, anonymously or share their names, and help
        families achieve their dreams of adopting a child in need. <br /> <br />

        Why us and not KickStarter or GoFundMe? Because we understand that adopting
        a child is of the utmost seriousness and you don't want your Family Fund
        next to a campaign for cat baths. <br /><br />Adopt Fund is here to help your
        family adopt a child.</p>
